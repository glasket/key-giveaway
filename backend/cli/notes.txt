Actions:
    CreateDrop
        Takes a Drop and posts it and its items to dynamo
            - Needs to prevent creating drops that are already expired
    AddDropItem
        Takes an item that defines a DropItem with DropId specified
            - Needs to make sure the DropId belongs to an active drop
    RemoveDrop
        Takes a drop id and deletes it from dynamo, along with all items
            - Maybe don't allow on expired drops?
    RemoveDropItem
        Removes the item with a given ID, only works if the parent drop is active
    

Maybe consider an "Undo" for raffles in case of errors?
